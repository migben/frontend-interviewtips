/**
* Front End Interview Questions: Responsive Design
* 
* Q: What is responsive design and how might you implement it?
    having your web app be functional and work in multiple screen
    sizes.

    This is tested or simulated in different devices and many of these 
    tests are done with media queries.

    There has been other implementations to help with the change of width and
    height of an application. Such as flexbox which uses its own css properties
    to set the layout.

    Another aspect of web design isn't just the proper scale of our app horizontally
    or whatnot but also the sizing of items via using different measurement units.
    example, rem, em , px or percentages for some of the fonts and images.
