Agile is really just a process how we run our engineering teams at
the end of the day. Is about setting some processes and procedures

Typically the most common version of this is Scrum. This is more centered
about how many points have we accumulated in our tickets. Our goal is to have
an actionable amount of work that we can learn from each sprint.

Sprint is typically a 2 week period of time that we deliver some form of value.
In our sprints, we could have stand ups in the morning where we talk what are we doing
what is blocking us and what we did the day before.

Agile and Scrum is all about team agreement. Pulling things in and out, when the team 
says this makes sense.

When does teams agreen that things are done /  finish. (this could vary from
    organization to organization.) Usually we could have a retrospective at the end
    or at the start of the next sprint. This is mostly to reflect how the team did and
    any potential changes we could make.
